# PySimSP0256AL2-001
A simulated SP0256-AL2 in Python.

This mini-project was a proof-of-concept to see if simulating an SP0256-AL2
with pre-recorded phonemes was feasible.  While quality noticeably suffers,
the result is also not that bad.

With that working, I further ported in one of my old text-to-speech
implementations, and ran a few test cases.
